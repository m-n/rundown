A small library for running a markdown file as a repl based
interactive tutorial.

Although the tutorials can be arbitrary markdown files, they are
displayed in a way which assumes:

    1. The file is written in short sections.
    2. Code sections are preceded by a clear call to action.
    3. A heading starts a sections.
    4. A code block ends a section. 

Like other interactive tutorials, this doles out bite-size chunks over
an interactive prompt, but unlike most of them there is no attempt to
verify that a step has been successfully completed when the user moves
to the next step. I find that such guards typically cause harm.
